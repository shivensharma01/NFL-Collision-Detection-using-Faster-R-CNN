# NFL Impact Detection Using Faster R-CNN

## Overview
This project implements a **Faster R-CNN** model for detecting player impacts in NFL game footage. The task involves analyzing sideline and endzone video frames, identifying bounding boxes around players, and detecting potential impacts. The project is part of the **NFL Impact Detection Kaggle competition**, where accurate impact detection is crucial for player safety and game analysis.
